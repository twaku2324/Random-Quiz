# Module 6 Random-Quiz
Week 6 challenge
## Your Task

As you proceed in your journey to becoming a front-end web developer, it’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework has taught you all the skills you need to succeed in this challenge.

##Installation

When working on the project I came across an alternative method of inputting the data so that the output in console reflects something similar to the desired outcome.

Github Link:

Download the starter code given on bootcamp spot.
Create a professional README file so that others can review yoru work and complete the challenge(to the best of their ability).

Click on 'settings' then 'pages' then on the Branch section select 'root' then save.
